# Grading System Project

This is a simple Python program that takes a student's score as input and returns the corresponding grade based on the Nigerian university grading system.

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate the use of basic conditional statements in Python and apply them to a real-world scenario: calculating student grades.

## 🧠 Grading Breakdown

| Score Range | Grade |
|-------------|-------|
| 70 - 100    | A     |
| 60 - 69     | B     |
| 50 - 59     | C     |
| 45 - 49     | D     |
| 40 - 44     | E     |
| 0 - 39      | F     |

## 📂 Files Included

- `grading.py` – Python script that handles the grading logic
- `grading_pseudocode.txt` – Pseudocode version of the grading system

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Run the `grading.py` file in any Python environment (like Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, or VS Code).
2. Enter a numerical score when prompted.
3. The program will print the grade (A–F) based on the input.
